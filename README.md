# Pivot Pawns
A find-the-match puzzle game for any number of players. Pivot Pawns can be played in 15-30 minutes and is intended for players who are at least eight years old.

## Components
  - 15 cards
      - Each card displays seven different icons. These consist of a _centre icon_ and six _peripheral icons_ which are arranged in a hexagon around the centre icon.
      - Each icon is displayed on three different cards.
      - For every pair of cards, there is exactly one icon that is displayed on both cards.
      - There are a total of thirty-five different icons.
      - Each icon is rendered in one of five colours: red, green, blue, yellow, or black.
  - 15 target tokens
      - Each target token displays one icon.
      - There is one target token for each card.
      - The target token for a given card displays that card's centre icon.
  - 5 pawns
      - There is one pawn in each of the five icon colours.
  - 5 placeholder tokens
      - There is one placeholder token in each of the five icon colours.
  - 1 sand timer (approximately thirty seconds)
  - 1 cloth bag

## Set Up
  - Shuffle the cards.
  - Deal the cards face up on the table in a tableau consisting of three rows and five columns.
  - Put the sand timer beside the tableau.
  - Put the target tokens into the cloth bag.
  - Place each pawn onto a card which has a centre icon of a different colour to that pawn. Do not place more than one pawn on any card.
  - Place each placeholder token onto the card where you placed the pawn of the same colour.



## Gameplay
The game takes place over a series of fifteen _rounds_.   During each round, your objective is to collect the target token for that round. To do so, you must move the _active pawn_ onto the _target card_. The active pawn is the pawn that matches the colour of the icon displayed on the target token. The target card is the card that displays the icon on the target token in its centre. The game ends after you have played fifteen rounds. Whoever has collected the most target tokens at the end of the game wins.

### Moving the Pawns
During the game, you will move the pawns around the tableau. When a pawn is placed onto a card, that card is _occupied_ by that pawn. Each card may be occupied by at most one pawn. You may not move the moving pawn onto a card that is occupied by another pawn.

To move a pawn, you perform an action called a _pivot_. To perform a pivot you will do the following:
  1. Identify the _moving pawn_. The moving pawn is the pawn that you will move as a result of this pivot action.
  2. Identify the _pivot pawn_. The pivot pawn will determine where you can move the moving pawn.
  3. Identify the _pivot icon_. The pivot icon is the icon that is displayed on both the card occupied by the moving pawn and the card occupied by the pivot pawn.
  4. Identify the _destination card_. The destination card is the card that displays the pivot icon and is not occupied by either the moving pawn or the pivot pawn.
  5. Move the moving pawn onto the destination card.

In most cases, you may not move a pawn onto a card on which has a centre icon of the same colour as that pawn. Crucially, however, you may move any pawn onto the target card during a given round. In fact, in order to collect the target token in each round, you must move the pawn that matches the colour of the centre icon of the target card onto that card.

### Playing A Round
At the beginning of each round, first draw a target token from the cloth bag and place it face up on the table. The round is then subdivided into three _phases_.

__Phase 1:__ During the first phase, the pawns move only in your minds. You should study the tableau and try to find a _solution_. A solution is a series of pivots that will deliver the active pawn to the target card in as few moves as possible. Note that your solution may involve moving any of the pawns and that the shortest solution will usually involve moving at least one pawn that is not the active pawn for that round.

__Phase 2:__ The second phase begins as soon as any player believes they have found a solution. That player should immediately announce the _length_ (the number of pivots required) of their solution. This length is that player's _bid_ for the round.  The bidding player should start the sand timer by turning it over. Everyone will then have thirty seconds to make additional bids. There is no order of bidding and you may make multiple bids. Once you have made a bid for a given round, you may not change it to a higher number.   

__Phase 3:__ The third phase begins when the sand timer runs out. At this time, the player with the lowest bid should attempt to _demonstrate_ their solution (see below). If their proposed solution is valid, then that player _succeeds_ and should collect the target token for the round. Otherwise, the player with the next lowest bid should attempt to demonstrate their solution. This continues until someone succeeds. If no one succeeds, then no one gets the target token. If two or more players have the same bid, then the bids should be resolved in the order in which they were were made.

### Demonstrating a Solution
To demonstrate a solution, you should execute the pivots required to move the active pawn onto the target card, counting aloud as you make each move. You should explicitly identify the moving pawn, the pivot pawn, and pivot icon for each pivot action. Your solution is _valid_ if all moves are legal and the solution delivers the active pawn to the target card in less than or equal to the number of moves you have bid. Otherwise it is _invalid_.

If, while demonstrating your solution, you make a mistake or discover that your solution is invalid, you should return the pawns to their original locations as indicated by the placeholder tokens. If your solution is valid, then you should move the placeholder tokens onto the same cards as their corresponding pawns.
